# Momentum_clone

## 1: Introduction to this web app

This is a clone project of Google Chrome Momentum I created only for Chingu pre-work.

## 2: Difference between original Momentum and mine

a. submit button

My Momentum app expcet you to type in your name and your focus on today, then submit.
Original one has the same function but it doesn't have submit button. You can just enter to type in your name and focus.

I struggled to make the same function so that users can type in their name and focus by just pressing "enter" key,
but it's still difficult for me to have that function since there are two input areas here.

b. weather and quotes function 

As I wrote in the introduction, my app doesn't have these functions YET. Honestly, I didn't have enough time to finish up implementing fetch APIs. 

## 3: Responsive Desgin

This is also the same to Google Chrome Memontum, but my app doesn't apply to mobile. 
Accordingly, the app might look bizarre on your phone. I recommend to check only on tablet or laptop. 

Enjoy!
